# useful-moonshine-onnx

Moonshine is a family of speech-to-text models optimized for fast and accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) on resource-constrained devices. This package contains inference code for using Moonshine models with the ONNX runtime. For more information, please refer to the [project repo on GitHub](https://github.com/usefulsensors/moonshine).
